        <div>
          <expandable-heading title="Best practices for data organisation in spreadsheets">
            <p>Good data organization is the foundation of any research project. Spreadsheets are tools that are commonly used to store data and we organize data in spreadsheets in the ways that we as humans want to work with the data. But computers require that data be organized in particular ways so in order to use tools that make computation more efficient, such as programming languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that computers need the data.</p>

            <p>This session will cover the best practices for using spreadsheets with data. This will include:
            <ul>
              <li>Learning about the "Tidy data" principles</li>
              <li>How to organise data according to "Tidy data" principles
              <li>Dealing wth dates</li>
              <li>Exporting data for use with other tools</li>
            </ul>

            This session would be useful for:
            <ul>
              <li>people who collect data</li>
              <li>people who want to begin analysing data</li>
            </ul>
          </p>


            <p>Targeted skill level: beginner</p>
            <p>Software required: spreadsheet program installed (e.g. MS Excel or Libre Office Calc)</p>
          </expandable-heading>

          <expandable-heading title="Digital notebooks">
            Note taking is a key part of research. Digital notebooks enable you to not only capture ideas but also enrich them with embedded images, links to reference material, and also let you modify and improve them while keeping track of the previous states. They can also be used as self-promotion of your work.

            This session will cover the creation of a simple web-based notebook that could serve as a lab notebook or blog. By the end of this workshop, participants will have covered:
            <ul>
              <li>Creating up a github account</li>
              <li>Creating a repository to store the notebook</li>
              <li>Introduction to markdown syntax for formatting</li>
              <li>Adding entries to the notebook</li>
              <li>Modifying existing entries</li>
              <li>Collaborating with multiple authors</li>
            </ul>

          <expandable-heading title="Introduction to Data">
            What is data? What data might I have? Is there an easier way to do what I'm doing? These are some of the questions that you may ask during your research and this session is designed to help you start answering these questions. Computational research is full of jargon making it difficult to know if a particular program is going to solve the problems you have. But being able to put names to your problems is powerful is being able to start solving them.

            This lesson (based on Library Carpentry) introduces librarians and others to working with data. At the conclusion of the lesson you will be able to:
            <ul>
              <li>define terms, phrases, and concepts in software development and data science</li>
              <li>understand what tasks are best performed by a computer</li>

            Have you found yourself repeating the same search but only making small changes each time? Maybe you want to know where all the occurances of a list of words are in a document. Instead of having to perform each search individually there are more efficient ways, such as creating code that embodies the commonalities in your search terms.<br>

          <expandable-heading title="Tidy data principles">
            <p>Good data organization is the foundation of any research project. Spreadsheets are tools that are commonly used to store data and we organize data in spreadsheets in the ways that we as humans want to work with the data. But computers require that data be organized in particular ways so in order to use tools that make computation more efficient, such as programming languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that computers need the data.</p>
		  <p><i>This session is extremely similar to that of "Best practices for data organisation in spreadsheets" on Monday.</i></p>
            <p>This session will cover the best practices for using spreadsheets with data. This will include:
            <ul>
              <li>Learning about the "Tidy data" principles</li>
              <li>How to organise data according to "Tidy data" principles
              <li>Dealing wth dates</li>
              <li>Exporting data for use with other tools</li>
            </ul>

            This session would be useful for:
            <ul>
              <li>people who collect data</li>
              <li>people who want to begin analysing data</li>
            </ul>
          </p>


            <p>Targeted skill level: beginner</p>
